# Recreate a classic 🕹️

## Create one (or more?!) of the following:

- Rock-Paper-Scissors
- Calculator (stretch, scientific)
- Noughts & Crosses
- Pong
- Whac-a-mole
- Stopwatch

The rule here is you CAN use Google, but you CAN'T google "how to make an X". As above, there are tutorials for how to do these all over the web, **do not use one**.

## Rules 📋

As always there are 3 rules:

- Have fun
- Don't cheat
- Have fun
